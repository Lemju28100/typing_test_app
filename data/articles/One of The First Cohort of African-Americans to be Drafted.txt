In May 1917,
he delivered a speech at the West Virginia
Collegiate Institute,
where he was a student,
in which he praised the valor
of black men on the battlefield:
“In this hour of dread, when nations are
being annihilated
and our own country stands upon the edge of this
whirlpool of destruction
and needs the loyal support of all its peoples,
it is well to remember these things that count
for the work of a people.
The Negro has never before been drafted and
has yet to prove himself
disloyal or a coward in the time of danger.
He has never been convicted of treason,
and a black hand has yet to be raised against
the flag of his country.
The story of the past guarantees the status of the
Negro at present and foreshadows that of the future.
Where he has stood, he now stands and will stand.
With malice toward none,
with charity for all — for his race, for his country,
for his God.”
After the war, Joseph married Mary Smith,
and they went on to have five children.
