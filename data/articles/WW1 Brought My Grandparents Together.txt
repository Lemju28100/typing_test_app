Joseph graduated from Indiana University
in 1918,
determined to join the military.
It took seven tries, because he was too
underweight for his height.
At age 18, Elizabeth Vogt joined the war
effort by entertaining
the troops at Fort Thomas under the stage
name Betty Earle.
After the war, Joe learned
Betty Earle’s company would be near where
he was working.
My uncle said that Joseph got on a train,
found Elizabeth and said, “We are getting married.”
They married on Aug. 28, 1920,
and she cried all night.
Eventually, they moved to
New Mexico and raised four children.
