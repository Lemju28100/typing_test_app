World War I brought my grandparents, Joseph L. Dailey and Elizabeth Vogt, together. 
Joseph graduated from Indiana University in 1918, determined to join the military. 
It took seven tries, because he was too underweight for his height. 
At age 18, Elizabeth Vogt joined the war effort by entertaining the troops at Fort Thomas under the stage name Betty Earle. 
After the war, Joe learned Betty Earle’s company would be near where he was working. 
My uncle said that Joseph got on a train, found Elizabeth and said, “We are getting married.” 
They married on Aug. 28, 1920, and she cried all night. 
Eventually, they moved to New Mexico and raised four children. — Janis Gatschet, Bluffton, S.C. From NY times
