My great-aunt, Minnie Strobel, served in the Army Nurse Corps. 
A farm girl from Mound City, Mo., she left home at 34 to become 
a nurse. Her station in Orleans, France, received soldiers directly from the front lines. 
Imagine the joy and gratitude of the soldiers and nurses when the armistice was signed on Nov. 11! 
This is her scrapbook account of Thanksgiving, three weeks later: “All was in readiness on time for the turkey and dressing. 
All ambulatory patients were seated at the table after the bed patients had their trays. 
Table after table were served. It was late afternoon before the last were served. 
Remarks such as this came from the boys: ‘Gee isn't this great!’ or ‘When was the last time I had my feet under the table?’
or ‘This is next to being at home.’ It was a great day. No one thought of being weary. 
One of the nurses' happiest days ever.” — Holly Buchanan, Snohomish, Wash. From NY Times
