My great-grandfather, Peter Court,
like many young men, was an absolute
bottomless pit at meals.
When dinner came in the trenches,
the men would argue over who should
fetch rations.
But Peter never argued because he knew he
could usually charm the kitchen into a
bit more for himself.
One evening when dinner was called,
Peter volunteered.
After successfully talking his way
to a little extra food at the kitchen,
he headed back with soup for the others,
only to find that a German shell had killed
his whole squad.
He made the best of the situation and sat down
and ate every last bit of soup.
